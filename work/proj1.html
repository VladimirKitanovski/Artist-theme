<p>Twitter-Bot: The Twitter API Bot is a project that uses Twitter's API which enables us to play around a bit. In my case I created a automated reply system so that when a user follows me or tweets me there is an automated reply, taking in consideration whether they followed or @ mentioned my account. Their is also a search method implemented where you can search specific keywords that have been tweeted (through the terminal) Account: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAutomatic">@VladAutomatic</a></p>You can also find the Git repository <a href="https://github.com/VladimirKitanovski/twitter-bot">HERE</a> Feel free to play around and make some changes, I would love to see some contributors.<br>
