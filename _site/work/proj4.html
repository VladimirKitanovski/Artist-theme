This is the project that go me started with analyzing data and converting it into results. Would also want to encourage people go to my <a href="https://github.com/VladimirKitanovski/Sentiment-Analysis-AppInterface">GitHub</a> page and play around with the code, would love to see some improvement. "Without data you're just another person"<br><br>"Torture the data, and it will confess to anything"<br><br>
